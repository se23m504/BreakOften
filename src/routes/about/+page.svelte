      BreakOften is a web application designed to help users prevent computer
      vision syndrome (CVS) by reminding them to take regular breaks from their
      screens. The app encourages users to take short breaks every 20 minutes
      and 20 seconds, followed by a longer break after every three short breaks.

      Computer vision syndrome is a common problem caused by prolonged use of
      digital screens, leading to symptoms such as eye strain, headaches, and
      neck pain. BreakOften aims to mitigate these symptoms by promoting regular
      breaks and encouraging users to engage in eye exercises and relaxation
      techniques during their breaks.
